This enhanced version of the Library Management System incorporates more advanced OOP concepts as requested. Here's a breakdown of the changes and additions:

Interface:

Added Borrowable interface for library items.
Added LibraryUser interface for different types of users.


Polymorphism:

The LibraryItem abstract class implements the Borrowable interface.
Different user types (RegularUser and PremiumUser) implement the LibraryUser interface.
The Library class uses LibraryItem and LibraryUser interfaces, allowing for different implementations.


Inheritance:

Book and DVD classes extend the LibraryItem abstract class.
This demonstrates how different types of library items can share common properties and behaviors.


Additional OOP Concepts:

Encapsulation: Private fields with public methods for access.
Abstraction: Abstract LibraryItem class and interfaces.


New Features:

Added a DVD class to demonstrate different types of library items.
Introduced Regular and Premium user types with different borrowing limits.
Used Java 8+ features like streams for filtering items.



This system now demonstrates a more comprehensive use of OOP concepts while maintaining and expanding its functionality. Users can borrow both books and DVDs, and the system differentiates between regular and premium users.
To use this system:

Save the code in a file named LibraryManagementSystem.java.
Compile the code using javac LibraryManagementSystem.java.
Run the program using java LibraryManagementSystem.

The system will initialize with sample books, DVDs, and users. When a new user enters the library, they'll be prompted to specify if they're a regular or premium user.
